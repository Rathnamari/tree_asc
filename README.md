***Overview***
This Python program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) using a class named tree. 
A BST is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. 
Nodes in the left subtree are less than the parent node, and nodes in the right subtree are greater than the parent node. 
This implementation allows insertion of new nodes and displays the tree in an in-order traversal.

***Algorithm***
If new_data is less than the current node's data (self.node), recursively insert into the left subtree.
If new_data is greater than the current node's data, recursively insert into the right subtree.
Base case: If a child subtree is None, create a new node with new_data.
